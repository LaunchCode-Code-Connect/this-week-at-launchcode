### Shout Outs and Congratulations

Each week, I'll give a shout out to candidates and general alumni putting in great work in this github group.
I'll also give congratulations to candidates that were able to get an apprenticeship, convert to a full-time hire, or were able to find a tech job on their own without LaunchCode's assistance.

Please shoot me an email at cfrauenhoffer@launchcode.org with these updates if you want a shoutout.

This week, we've got a big congrats to Paul Filipkowski!!! 
He accepted a Software Developer 1 position at Distribution Management

Also, a big congrats to Aswini Ramamoorthy and Lakshmi Pasala for receiving Data Engineer-Reporting position offers from Centene!!!
