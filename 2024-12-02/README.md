# December 2nd 2024 - This Week At LaunchCode

### Volunteer Opportunities

There are currently no volunteer opportunities for this next month.

### Shout Outs and Congratulations

Each week, I'll give a shout out to candidates and general alumni putting in great work in this github group.
I'll also give congratulations to candidates that were able to get an apprenticeship, convert to a full-time hire, or were able to find a tech job on their own without LaunchCode's assistance.

Please shoot me an email at cfrauenhoffer@launchcode.org with these updates if you want a shoutout.

This week, we've got a big congrats to Paul Filipkowski!!! 
He accepted a Software Developer 1 position at Distribution Management

Also, a big congrats to Aswini Ramamoorthy and Lakshmi Pasala for receiving Data Engineer-Reporting position offers from Centene!!!

### Other News

Excited to have you all join this new Github Community!
If you run into any technical issues interacting with the group, please shoot me an email including any relevant screenshots to cfrauenhoffer@launchcode.org.
